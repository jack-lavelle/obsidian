*I am going to rework my approach since it is a complete failure. Instead, I will start with **keeping track of my schedule as it unfolds.*** This way I can get a sense of what is going on and develop / tweak my schedule that way.

| Event | Actual Interval |  
| -------- | -------- | 
| Work Session 1 | 10am - 1:30pm | 
| Lunch | 1:30 - 2pm |
| Work Session 2 | 2 - 5pm |
| Bullshitting | 5 - 6pm |
| Gym | 6 - 7:30pm |
| Dinner / Bullshitting | 7:30pm - 12am |

**Reflection:**
I need more discipline in my day and to be more aware as to how I am *actually* living my life. My current screen time is **4 hours** and that seems ridiculous. 

*Things to improve:*
1) reading philosophy (starting with Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle's chapter in Russell's *History of Western Philosophy* pdf page 99)
2) reading history (starting with Napoleon's campaigns in Italy ... *maybe starting from scratch completely*)
3) I should make subjects for math, and CS as well.
4) devoting time to leetcode / personal projects. *these will not get done with no effort*
5) making diet and exercise the core source of my will.

***I must write a reflection everyday. Also need something to keep track of my notes / thoughts during the day. The equivalent of a notebook but using my phone.***
