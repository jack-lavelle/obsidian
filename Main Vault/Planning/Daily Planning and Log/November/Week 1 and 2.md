## Sunday, October 29th

*October is coming to end and the fall is soon to be properly underway. This month has been a social success but almost all other areas have been failures. I need more focus on 1) work, 2) technical hobbies (leetcode and personal projects), 3) non-technical hobbies (philosophy and history) and 4) the gym.*

- [ ] #novWeek1 Review and digest the last two months work of information. Be critical and set goals for the following two months.
- [ ] #novWeek1 Set goals for personal projects, philosophy, history, and leetcode. Weekly goals.
- [ ] #novWeek1 Sleep schedule must be dealt with.
- [ ] #novWeek1 Get better about using Obsidian's map.
