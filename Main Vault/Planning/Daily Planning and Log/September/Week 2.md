Not enough notes taken.

Still working at 1:33pm ... definitely not good. Did take a mini-snack break at 10:30am. Preventing these work sessions lasting this long is definitely important and should be emphasized going forward.

Cleaned, started laundry, and made lunch. Eating now 1:52pm.

Working now at 2:30pm
