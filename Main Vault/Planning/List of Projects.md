The Video Game Project
- [ ] Reconnaissance should be important!!! Fog of War should be misleading, deceiving even, depending on relative skill of spy network, spy master, etc.
- [ ] inspirations should be:
	* Berserk
	* Lord of the Rings
	* Mount and Blade
	* Skyrim
	* FIFA (I know but really)
	* Star Wars (don't speak shit)

- [ ] /r/reasonablefantasy
- [ ] learn to make assets
- [ ] decide on engine (probably unreal)
- [ ] goblin slayer ep3 - camping should be time for party ... must have lookouts for sleep ... random events to get attacked
- [ ] maybe first game could be just along a caravan route and have random encounters
- [ ] lore cutscenes
- [ ] Gameplay loop brainstorming:
	1) empty map
	2) factions try to colonize the map
		1) different kinds of factions:
			1) counties / duchies / kingdoms / empires
			2) combat guilds (hunters, mercs, bandits, magic, fighers (maybe further split that into archery, swordsmen, etc))
			3) profession guilds (thieves, assassins, traders, mining, farming, etc) - these should be more powerful than peasants (these can be thought of as being *organized* peasants that have furthered themselves to have *some sway* to their governments)
			4) peasants
		Everyone is continuously (depending on personality traits) trying to further themselves into higher being. The player will only encounter a dozen or so of these NPCs so
