### NoSQL vs. RDMS

- [ ] #task The NoSQL vs RDMS question.

This question is still unanswered but here is a start: 

https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/235707/using-a-relational-database-vs-json-objects-for-event-activity-data.

The reason for it being unanswered is that the resolution of the situation that inspired the question did not touch on the general question itself. 

That solution was whether I should store data that are Python dictionaries (data like *enemies, skills,* and, *classes*) as 1 - Python dictionaries, 2 - JSON files, or 3 - proper SQL databases. Its resolution was that the data itself was small enough that Python dictionaries are fine.
