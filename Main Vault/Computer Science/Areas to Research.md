The general topic you are referring to falls under the broader category of "Computer Memory Management" or "Memory Hierarchies." Within this field, discussions on stack frames, call stack depths, and other memory considerations often relate to the study of "Computer Architecture" and "Systems Programming."

If you're looking for textbooks or resources to delve deeper into these topics, you might find the following books useful:

1. **"Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface" by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy:**
    
    - This book provides a comprehensive introduction to computer architecture and covers topics such as memory hierarchies, assembly language, and the interaction between hardware and software.
2. **"Operating System Concepts" by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne:**
    
    - This book covers a broad range of operating system concepts, including memory management, process scheduling, and resource allocation. Understanding these concepts is crucial for understanding how programs interact with memory.
3. **"Programming Language Pragmatics" by Michael L. Scott:**
    
    - This book explores various aspects of programming languages, including memory management and the underlying systems principles that impact program execution.
4. **"Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective" by Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron:**
    
    - Focused on the interface between software and hardware, this book provides insights into computer systems and covers topics such as machine-level representation of programs, memory hierarchy, and performance optimization.
5. **"Modern Operating Systems" by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos:**
    
    - This book covers modern operating system principles, including process management, memory management, and file systems, providing a good understanding of how software interacts with the underlying hardware.

Remember to check the specific chapters or sections related to memory management, stack frames, and call stacks in these textbooks, as these topics are often covered in-depth as part of broader discussions on computer systems and architecture.

#### Stack Overflows in Response to Recursion
Recursion on large trees can cause stack overflows when the program ends up making too many recursive calls before it ever has a chance to complete them. This happens because the memory that has been allocated for the stack frame is used up completely.
