My experience at Wolfram in bullet points:
* Backend Java / Mathematica engineer using Spring, MySQL, Maven / Ant / Gradle, Hibernate, Apache
* RESTful Web Services
* EPC environment -> Linux VMs, VPNs, Port forwarding etc
* CloudPlatform status API
* Quartz (all task-like objects)
* XML build files
* Unit testing

1) Tasks
2) CloudPlatform Status API
3) Kernel Configuration / Initialization
4) Delete API - include API conslidation and optimization, adding profiling


1) Significantly improved the robustness and efficiency of a Java / MySQL based task system framework, which allows users to run user-defined code, through the use of collaborative refactoring, improving unit testing coverage, and optimizing database queries.

2) Allowed for real-time monitoring of the performance and stability of our Java Spring web application by implementing a REST API based on a singleton class that utilized synchronization to handle concurrent access and possible race conditions.

3) Made more efficient the initialization and management of Mathematica cloud kernels by consolidating the configuration of a user agent string associated with an API request of our Java Spring web application.



Implemented an API that exposes a Java Spring Boot webapp's status information v
