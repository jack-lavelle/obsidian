*Entry written on September 9th, 2023*

The idea for the continuation of project is best introduced using the prototypical image:

![[the-plan.png]]
There are quite a few things to consider with this and before I take on the actual project I need to think about how to organize this in terms of whether I want to use Git Issues at all, or go purely through Obsidian Tasks. For now I will use Obsidian Tasks but will keep the idea open.

#### Clean Code
- [ ] #SCG #cleancode Need to rework a driver method for `render_template()`
- [ ] #SCG #cleancode Unit testing.
#### Suggestions
It is best that the ideas for this website come from not only me, but the internet and as such I will allow users (users which don't exist yet ...) to add suggestions to the website. Users will be able to vote on other suggestions, of which the top 5 will be shown on the website and they'll have the option to check for more.

**Specific Tasks**
- [ ] #SCG #suggestions Add ability to add your own suggestion.
- [ ] #SCG #suggestions Add ranking of already existing suggestions.
- [ ] #SCG #suggestions Add view more button.

#### Users
I will add the ability for people to make accounts with which they can:
1) keep track of their previous characters,
2) add suggestions on what I can improve / add on the website,
3) add their own reviews of certain character builds,
4) add their own challenges / recommended mods / modlists.

#### Character Generation
- [ ] #SCG #chargen I need to add the ability to put in custom values for each entry.
- [ ] #SCG #chargen Add a `save character` button which will add the character to the `my characters` screen.
- [ ] #SCG #chargen  Add a `publish character` button on `my characters`.
