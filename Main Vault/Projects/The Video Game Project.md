Combat should have weight.

Towns should feel alive, notice board, travelers, merchants, guards, peasants, farmers coming to the market, crime, etc...s

unique items "think of saber's sword season 2 ep 11"

know of each other, and that you are just another one temporarily there ... nothing special ... think of the big six in premier league and then the

few teams outside of that rise and fall quite often.

soul eater ep 1 for rewarding sound effects and good sound design
