I am about to go to the gym and I want to have accomplished the following before I sleep:
* Make PR for what I have found regarding VPN, SSH, Activation Server, etc. (1 hr)
* LeetCode (2 hrs)
* Fortnite with Connor (2 hrs)
* Nutrition Genome (2 hrs)
* Dinner and shake (1 and a half hour)
9 and a half hours .... we'll see.
